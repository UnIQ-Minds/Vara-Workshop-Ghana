# UnIQ Minds Vara Education Initiative

The **UnIQ Minds Vara Education Initiative** aims to introduce developers, students, and tech enthusiasts in Ghana to the Vara ecosystem and Web3 technologies. Our goal is to educate participants through hands-on workshops, helping them build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Gear blockchain using Rust and the Gear JS API.

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for the materials, resources, and code examples for the workshops. The initiative will cover smart contract development using Rust, interacting with the Vara blockchain, and building decentralized applications using the Gear JS API.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UnIQ-Minds-Vara-Education.git

This repository contains the following:

Workshop Presentations: Materials for each workshop session, covering essential topics in the Vara ecosystem.
Sample Code: Examples of basic smart contracts using Rust and the Gear "std" library, as well as frontend code using the Gear JS API.
Roadmap: A detailed plan for the workshops and the development of the community.
